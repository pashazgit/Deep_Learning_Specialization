# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (offered by deeplearning.ai)

Programming assignments and quizzes from all courses in the Coursera [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Credits

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, quiz questions and diagrams are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified otherwise.

## Disclaimer

I recognize the time people spend on building intuition. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions. This course is a treasure by the deeplearning.ai team.
